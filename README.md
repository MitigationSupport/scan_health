# Veracode Scan Health üè•

This is an unofficial Veracode product. It does not come with any support or warrenty.

Use this console tool to see the health of Veracode Static Analysis (SAST) scans and get some suggestions to improve scan performance anf flaw quality. The scans must have completed for the tool to work.

## Usage

We recommend you configure a Veracode API credentials file as documented here: https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_configure_api_cred_file.

Alternatively you can use environment variables (`VERACODE_API_KEY_ID` and `VERACODE_API_KEY_SECRET`) or CLI flags (`-vid` and `-vkey`) to authenticate with the Veracode APIs.

```
./scan_health -h
