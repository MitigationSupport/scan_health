# Veracode Scan Health üè•

This is an unofficial Veracode product. It does not come with any support or warranty.

Use this console tool to see the health of Veracode Static Analysis (SAST) scans and get some suggestions to improve
scan performance and flaw quality. The scans must have completed for the tool to work.

## Key Features ‚úÖ

* Identification of configuration issues and recommendations for improvements
* Can output to JSON

## Usage

To use the tool you will need Veracode API credentials. We recommend you configure a Veracode API credentials file as
documented here: <https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_configure_api_cred_file>. Alternatively you can use environment
variables (`VERACODE_API_KEY_ID` and `VERACODE_API_KEY_SECRET`) or the CLI flags (`-vid` and `-vkey`) to authenticate
with the Veracode APIs.

```sh
./scan_health -h
Scan Health v2.00

Usage:
  -format string
        Output format [console, json] (default "console")
  -profile string
        Veracode credential profile - See https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_httpie_tool#using-multiple-profiles (default "default")
  -region string
        Veracode Region [commercial, us, european]
  -sast string
        Veracode Platform URL or build ID for a SAST application health review
  -vid string
        Veracode API ID - See https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_create_api_creds
  -vkey string
        Veracode API key - See https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_create_api_creds
```

### Example

```sh
./scan_health -sast https://analysiscenter.veracode.com/auth/index.jsp#StaticOverview:75603:793744:22132159:22103486:22119136::::5000002
```

Here is an example output of the tool.

Issues
======
‚ùå A Java module was identified that contained no compiled Java classes: "common-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar". Sometimes this can indicate the file contained only Java source code which is not processed by Veracode.
‚ö†Ô∏è 2 unnecessary files were uploaded: ".DS_Store", "._.DS_Store".
‚ö†Ô∏è 2 JavaScript modules were not selected for analysis: "JS files within common-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar", "JS files within auth-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar".
‚ö†Ô∏è There have not been recent scans of this application The application was last scanned on 2023-01-31 08:52:10 +0000 GMT which was 148d 5h 52m 24.452762s ago. It is not uncommon for new flaws to be reported over time because Veracode is continuously improving their products, and because new SCA vulnerabilities are reported every day, and this could impact the application.

Recommendations
===============
üí° Follow the packaging instructions to keep the upload as small as possible in order to improve upload and scan times.
üí° Veracode requires the Java application to be compiled into a JAR, WAR or EAR file as per the packaging instructions.
üí° Veracode extracts JavaScript modules from the upload. Consider selecting the appropriate "JS files within ..." modules for analysis in order to cover the JavaScript risk from these components.
üí° Under-selection of first party modules affects results quality. Ensure the correct entry points have been selected as recommended and refer to this article: https://community.veracode.com/s/article/What-are-Modules-and-how-do-my-results-change-based-on-what-I-select.
üí° Regular scanning, preferably via automation will allow the application team to respond faster to any new issues reported.
üí° Consider scheduling a consultation to review the packaging and module configuration: https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_schedule_consultation.

## Different ways to run

Using Docker üê≥:

```sh
docker run -t -v "$HOME/.veracode:/.veracode" antfie/scan_health -sast https://analysiscenter.veracode.com/auth/index.jsp#StaticOverview:75603:793744:22132159:22103486:22119136::::5000002
```

With the zsh helper:

add this to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
alias vsh='f() { /path/to/scan_health-mac-arm64 -sast "$1" };f'
```

Then you can simply run:

```sh
vsh https://analysiscenter.veracode.com/auth/index.jsp#StaticOverview:75603:793744:22132159:22103486:22119136::::5000002
```

If you know the build IDs you can use them instead of URLs if preferred, like so:

```sh
./scan_health -sast 22132159
```

## Development üõ†Ô∏è

You may want to run using the `-cache=true` flag to speed up development.

### Compiling

```sh
./build.sh
```

## Bug Reports üêû
